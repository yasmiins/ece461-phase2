# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Selenium Testing

## Requirements

### Install Selenium

In order to install selenium, you need to use pip. Pip comes with Python version 3.4 and later by default. If you do not have Python installed, use this link to [install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Go to your terminal and use the pip command: `pip install selenium`

You can check if selenium is installed by typing in the command `pip list` which will show a list of all the packages you have installed using pip. If one of the packages listed is named "selenium" then you have correctly installed selenium.

If the install command does not work, you can try any of the commands below:
`pip3 install selenium`
`python -m pip install selenium`
`python3 -m pip install selenium`

## Running Selenium Tests

In your terminal, navigate to the folder where you have stored the project and make sure to start the React application (instructions above). Once it is up and running, enter into your terminal `python3 ./test/selenium_tests.py`
